Team 5 for project 2

Members: deytia, rjlusk10, auxiliary

Notes: 

1. The cloning is multi-threaded
1. This team's repos were extracted into a new file with a python script
1. Timing the procedure is done using the Linux time command
1. Locks are used for two things:
    - The counter that counts the number of cloned repos
    - Waiting for rsync to finish
